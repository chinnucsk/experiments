SigMatch
--------

Want to match a few billion patterns against a text-string. No Problem! 
SigMatch is an algorithm for fast scalable multi-pattern matching. It uses
bloomfilters to determine if a text-string possibly matches a pattern or determines
its not in the set. If it detects that a text string may match a pattern we store a list of
possible matches inside ETS for quick run-time checking.
